      <p>There shouldn't be a spearate IT world, there shouldn't be a "computer guy". There should be productive, collaborative teams which succesfully utilize all their resources. </p>

      <p>As a customer success manager I have brought initial leads into the fold, demo'd platforms and provided sales support. I synthesize user requirements and provide training for out-of-the-box solutions or create enhancements and new features to customize a solution. I am the project manager for POC environments and provide new customer onboarding and training, as well as subsequent high-level customer support. Working with small tech companies, I bridge the gap between development heavy teams and layman stakeholders, ensuring that communication is succesful and that documentation - whether whitepapers, release notes, or training materials is clear and concise.

        Most recently I have segued into devlopment so that I can bridge the gap between project manager for the customer to project manager of the devlopment team working on their custom solutions.
      </p>

      <p>My customer experience includes large enterprise, blue-chip corporations, government entities both state and federal, FEDRAMP CSP, and extensive collaboration with Microsoft teams on behalf of one of their partners.</p>
